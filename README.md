# Book Analysis Project

This project is a simple Python script that I completed as a guided project through boot.dev. It performs a basic analysis on a text file, specifically Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein". 

The script reads in the contents of the text file, and based on that, it calculates the number of words and the frequency of each alphabetic character. It then prints a report displaying these statistics.
